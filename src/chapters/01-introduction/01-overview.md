# Overview of PDEs

In this section, we will discuss the basic definitions and classifications of PDEs.

## Definitions

A PDE is an equation that relates a function with its partial derivatives. For example, the heat equation is given by:

$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}$$

where \(u(x, t)\) represents the temperature distribution.

## Types of PDEs

- **Order**: The highest derivative in the equation.
- **Linearity**: PDEs can be linear or nonlinear based on the relationship between the variables and their derivatives.

## Problem 1

Identify a real-world scenario where PDEs are applicable.

<answer>
PDEs are widely used in:
1. Heat conduction in a metal plate (Heat equation).
2. Vibrations of a drum (Wave equation).
3. Fluid dynamics (Navier-Stokes equations).
4. Quantum mechanics (Schr√∂dinger equation).
