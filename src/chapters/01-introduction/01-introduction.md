# Notice
This set of notes is built based on the lectures given by Dr. Kalyana B. Nakshatrala 
in undergraduate courses. The main intention of this set of notes is to quickly equip 
the students with the necessary mathematical preliminaries so that they can enjoy the 
beautiful journey while taking mechanics courses: Mechanics I - Statics, 
and Mechanics of Solids. These lessons are dedicated to students.
