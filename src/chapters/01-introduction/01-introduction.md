# Introduction to Partial Differential Equations

Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are equations that involve partial derivatives of a function of multiple independent variables. They are crucial for modeling various physical phenomena.

## Importance of PDEs

PDEs are essential in fields such as physics, engineering, and finance. They help describe processes like heat conduction, fluid flow, and wave propagation.

## Real-World Applications

- **Heat Conduction**: Analyzing temperature distribution over time.
- **Fluid Dynamics**: Understanding how fluids behave under various conditions.
- **Quantum Mechanics**: Describing wave functions and probabilities.

## Overview of Chapters

This curriculum will cover fundamental concepts, methods for solving PDEs, and their applications across various fields.
