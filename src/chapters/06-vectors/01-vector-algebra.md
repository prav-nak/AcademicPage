# Part I: Vector Algebra

*Every person in your company is a vector. Your progress is determined by the sum of all vectors.*

## Introduction to Vectors

Vectors are mathematical entities that have both magnitude and direction. They are used extensively in physics and engineering.

### Key Concepts

- **Magnitude**: The length of the vector.
- **Direction**: The angle at which the vector acts.

## Operations with Vectors

1. **Addition**: The process of combining two vectors to form a resultant vector.
2. **Scalar Multiplication**: Multiplying a vector by a scalar to change its magnitude.

### Example

Consider two vectors:
- **A** = (3, 4)
- **B** = (1, 2)

The sum of these vectors is:
$$
\text{Resultant} = A + B = (3+1, 4+2) = (4, 6)
$$

## Conclusion

Understanding vector algebra is essential for various fields, including physics, computer science, and economics.
