# Financial Applications of PDEs

PDEs play a crucial role in financial mathematics, particularly in option pricing.

## Black-Scholes Equation

The Black-Scholes equation is a fundamental PDE in financial derivatives pricing.

$$\frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 S^2 \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2} + rS \frac{\partial V}{\partial S} - rV = 0$$

where \(V\) is the option price, \(S\) is the stock price, \(\sigma\) is volatility, and \(r\) is the risk-free interest rate.
