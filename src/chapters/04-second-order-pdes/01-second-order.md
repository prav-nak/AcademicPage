# Second-Order PDEs

This chapter delves into second-order PDEs and their classifications.

## Classifications of Second-Order PDEs

- **Elliptic**: Steady-state solutions (e.g., Laplace's equation).
- **Parabolic**: Time-dependent diffusion (e.g., heat equation).
- **Hyperbolic**: Wave propagation (e.g., wave equation).

## Example Problem

Classify the PDE:

$$\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} - \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} = 0$$

<answer>
This is a hyperbolic PDE.
