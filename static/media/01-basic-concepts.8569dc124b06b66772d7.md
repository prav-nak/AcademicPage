# Fundamental Concepts of PDEs

This section introduces essential terminology and concepts in PDEs.

## Definition of Order

The order of a PDE is determined by the highest derivative present in the equation. For instance, in:

$$\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = 0$$

the order is 2.

## Linear vs. Nonlinear PDEs

- **Linear PDEs**: Superposition principle holds. Example:

  $$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + c \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 0$$

- **Nonlinear PDEs**: Superposition does not hold. Example:

  $$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}$$
