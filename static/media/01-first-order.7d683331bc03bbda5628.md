# Solving First-Order PDEs

This chapter focuses on techniques for solving first-order PDEs.

## Method of Characteristics

The method of characteristics transforms a PDE into a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs).

## Example Problem

Solve the first-order PDE:

$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + c \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 0$$

<answer>
The solution is given by $u(x, t) = f(x - ct)$.
</answer>

## Additional Problem

Given the initial condition $u(x, 0) = \sin(x)$, what is the solution?

<answer>
The solution is $u(x, t) = \sin(x - ct)$.
</answer>
