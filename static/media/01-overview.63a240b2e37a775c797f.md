# Overview of Partial Differential Equations

Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are fundamental in describing various physical phenomena. This chapter provides an introduction to the basic concepts and importance of PDEs.

## What are PDEs?

PDEs are equations that involve partial derivatives of multivariate functions. They are used to model problems where the rate of change of a quantity depends on multiple independent variables.

## Problem 1

Can you identify a real-world scenario where PDEs are applicable?

<answer>
PDEs are widely applicable in various fields. Some examples include:

1. Heat conduction in a metal plate (Heat equation)
2. Vibrations of a drum (Wave equation)
3. Fluid dynamics (Navier-Stokes equations)
4. Quantum mechanics (Schr√∂dinger equation)

In the next section, we'll delve deeper into the basic concepts of PDEs.
