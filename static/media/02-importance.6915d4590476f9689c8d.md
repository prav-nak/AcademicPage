# Importance of PDEs

Understanding the significance of PDEs is crucial for applying them effectively in real-world scenarios.

## Role in Physics and Engineering

PDEs model dynamic systems where changes occur over time and space. Examples include:

- **Wave Equation**: Models sound waves, light waves, and water waves.
- **Heat Equation**: Describes how heat diffuses through a given region.

## Applications in Other Fields

PDEs are also important in finance, where they can model options pricing and risk.

## Example Problem

Consider the initial condition for the heat equation:

$$u(x, 0) = f(x)$$
