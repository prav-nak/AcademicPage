# Basic Concepts of PDEs

This section introduces fundamental concepts and terminology used in the study of Partial Differential Equations.

## Order of a PDE

The order of a PDE is determined by the highest derivative in the equation.

## Problem 1

What is the order of the following PDE?

$$\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} = 0$$

<answer>
The order of this PDE is 2. The highest derivatives in the equation are second-order partial derivatives with respect to x and y.

## Linear vs. Nonlinear PDEs

PDEs can be classified as linear or nonlinear based on certain criteria.

We'll explore these concepts further in the upcoming chapters.
