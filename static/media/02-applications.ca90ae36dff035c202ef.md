# Applications of First-Order PDEs

First-order PDEs have significant applications in various fields.

## Traffic Flow

The traffic flow can be modeled using a first-order PDE, helping to optimize traffic signals and road designs.

## Example Problem

Model the traffic flow using the equation:

$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + k \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 0$$

where \(u\) represents the traffic density.

<answer>
The solution is $u(x, t) = f(x - kt)$.
