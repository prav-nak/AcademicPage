# Applications of PDEs

This chapter explores various applications of PDEs across multiple fields.

## Heat Equation Applications

The heat equation models how heat diffuses through a solid. It has applications in thermal analysis and materials science.

## Example Problem

Given the boundary conditions for the heat equation, solve for temperature distribution:

$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}, \quad u(0, t) = 0, \quad u(L, t) = 0$$

<answer>
Solutions can be found using separation of variables, yielding a series solution.
