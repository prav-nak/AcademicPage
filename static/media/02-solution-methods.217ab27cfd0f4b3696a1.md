# Methods for Solving Second-Order PDEs

Several techniques are used to solve second-order PDEs.

## Separation of Variables

This technique involves assuming a solution can be expressed as a product of functions, each depending on a single variable.

## Example Problem

Solve the wave equation:

$$\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}$$

<answer>
The general solution is $u(x, t) = f(x - ct) + g(x + ct)$.
